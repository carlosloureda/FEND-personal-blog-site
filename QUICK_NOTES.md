# Desktop Design

## Main Page

- I want to have a dark theme for this
- I like a lot the codesandbox design so maybe the cards can be like there are there.
- Maybe cards could have a nice animation while loading ...
- I want to have the navigation aside so the header will just have the title and the logo.
- On the sidebar I might put 2 sections:

  - About the site or me
  - Archive
    - Month 1 --> Links to a page with the posts of that date (like the home maybe)
    - Month 2 -->
  - Social links
  - Subscribe link (open on modal the form to subscribe)

- Footer with just who created the webpage and thanksgiving links
