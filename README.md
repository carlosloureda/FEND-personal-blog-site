# Personal Blog Site

First project for the Front End Nanodegree for Udacity that I am mentoring, here you need to creat a personal blog site with just HTML & CSS. We will keep things easy and on the future I will create some branches or side projects with more advanced functionalities for builing some independant courses for my mentoring sessions.

## Installation

- Download to your project directory.
- Open `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.

## Requirements

This project requires you to utilize your HTML and CSS skills to build out a personal blog website, including custom images, layout, and styling. Along with webpage design considerations, you'll work to appropriately structure your files, as well as use proper CSS and HTML formatting & style.

To complete the project, you are able to decide on the HTML and CSS files to include as part of your work, given that the end result is within the confines of the project rubric provided below. This should include, at minimum, HTML files related to:

- the blog website
- an example blog post
- as well as any related CSS files for styling.

### Structure

**CSS Separate From HTML**

1. Portfolio completely separates structure from design/style.
2. There are no attributes present in the body of the document.
3. There are no elements in the document.

**CSS Imports**

There should be at least 3 imported files in the main CSS file, but the student is welcome to break it down even further if that makes it easier for them.

**Directories & Files**

Files are organized with a directory structure that separates files based on page and functionality.

**Links**

There is an intentional user flow on each page with appropriate links as needed.

### Design

**Custom Design**

Custom images, layout, and styling.

**Foundations/Building Blocks**

- Typography: Custom design for typography with at least 3 unique properties for each typography selector

  1. Headers (h1 to h3 at minimum) `<h1>`
  2. Paragraph Text `<p>`
     a. Bold
     b. Italic
     c. Underlined
  3. Links `<a>`
  4. Quotes

- Colors: At least 3 colors are used.

**Components**

The following are used in the webpage:

- Image(s)
- Image caption
- Buttons
- Card

**Patterns**

The general pattern of the webpage should be as follows:

- Blog Homepage

  - Navbar
  - Blog Post Card
    - Card
    - Image
    - Buttons
    - Footer

- Blog Post
  - Header
  - Author Info
    - Name
    - Title
    - Current Company/School
    - Short Bio
    - Avatar
  - Social Sharing
    - Twitter
    - Facebook
    - LinkedIn

**Pages**

The following pages should be present:

1. Blog Homepage
2. Blog Post

### Layout

**Flexbox Based Layout**
Uses Flexbox at least twice throughout the project to create a component or pattern

**Grid Based Layout**
Uses CSS Grid at least twice throughout the project to create the layout for pages

### Responsiveness

**Multi-Device Web Design**

Pages are mobile-friendly and display correctly on all display sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop).

Note: You can [simulate Mobile Devices with Device Mode in Chrome DevTools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/device-mode/).

### Quality

**Valid HTML**

- HTML5 semantic tags such as `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<article>`, `<section>` , etc. are used to add meaning to the code.
- No div or section selectors are without a CSS class or id.

**HTML Formatting Rules**

- All code is lowercase
- The code does not have trailing white spaces.
- Indentation is consistent (either all tabs or all 2 spaces or all 4 spaces etc).
- Code uses a new line for every block, list or table element and indent every such child element (it is acceptable to put all elements in one line).
- When quoting attribute values, code uses consistent quotation marks (single vs. double).

**HTML Style Rules**

- HTML documents HTML5 `<!doctype html>`
- Code omits type attributes for style sheets and scripts.
- [Optional] Code does not use entity references unless necessary e.g. characters with special meaning (like < and &) as well as control or “invisible” characters (like no-break spaces).

**CSS Formatting Rules**

- The code does not have trailing white spaces.
- Indentation is consistent (either all tabs or all 2 spaces or all 4 spaces etc).
- Code indents all content, that is rules within rules as well as declarations to reflect hierarchy and improve understanding.
- The code uses a semicolon after every declaration for consistency and extensibility reasons.
- Code always uses a space after a property name's colon, but no space between property and colon, for consistency reasons.
- Code always uses a single space between the last selector and the opening brace that begins the declaration block. Code always start a new line for each selector and declaration.
- Code always put a blank line (two line breaks) between rules.
- Code uses consistent quotation marks for attribute selectors or property values (single vs. double).

**CSS Style Rules**

- The code uses meaningful or generic ID and class names that are as short as possible, but as long as necessary.
- The code does not use element names in conjunction with IDs or classes.
- The code uses shorthand properties where possible.
- [Optional] Code omits unit specification after 0 values.
- [Optional] Code includes leading 0s in decimal values for readability.
- [Optional] Code uses 3-character hexadecimal notation where possible.
- [Optional] Code separates words in ID and class names by a hyphen.
