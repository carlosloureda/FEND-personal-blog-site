            <strong>Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope</strong>, originally
            released as Star Wars, and currently marketed as simply Star Wars: A
            New Hope[3] is a 1977 film written and directed by
            <a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/George_Lucas"
              >George Lucas</a
            >. It is the first film in the
            <a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars"
              >Star Wars original trilogy</a
            >.
          </p>

          <p>
            The film is set about nineteen years after the formation of the
            Galactic Empire; construction has finished on the Death Star, a
            weapon capable of destroying a planet. After Princess Leia Organa, a
            leader of the Rebel Alliance, receives the weapon's plans in the
            hope of finding a weakness, she is captured and taken to the Death
            Star. Meanwhile, a young farmer named Luke Skywalker meets Obi-Wan
            Kenobi, who has lived in seclusion for years on the desert planet of
            Tatooine. When Luke's home is burned and his aunt and uncle killed,
            Obi-Wan begins Luke's Jedi training as they—along with Han Solo,
            Chewbacca, C-3PO and R2-D2—attempt to rescue the princess from the
            Empire.
          </p>

            Inspired by films like the Flash Gordon serials and the samurai
            films of Akira Kurosawa, as well as such critical works as Joseph
            Campbell's The Hero with a Thousand Faces and Frank Herbert's Dune
            books, Lucas began work on Star Wars in 1974. Ground-breaking in its
            use of special effects, this is considered to be among the most
            successful—and most influential—films of all time. Produced with a
            budget of US$11,000,000 and released on May 25, 1977, the film
            became one of the most successful of all time, earning $215 million
            in the United States and $337 million overseas during its original
            theatrical release, as well as winning several film awards,
            including 10 Academy Award nominations. It was re-released several
            times, sometimes with significant changes; the most notable versions
            were the 1997 Special Edition and the 2004 DVD, which were modified
            with CGI effects and recreated scenes. It was re-released in the
            Blu-ray format in September of 2011. The film was selected to be
            preserved by the Library of Congress as part of its National Film
            Registry. The film was selected in 1989, the program's first year in
            existence.

          <h3>Synopsis</h3>
          <p>
            Assault on Tantive IV Approximately nineteen years after the
            formation of the Galactic Empire, the galaxy is in a state of civil
            war. The Rebel Alliance has won their first major victory by
            stealing plans to the Galactic Empire's secret weapon, the Death
            Star. Hoping that the stolen plans can save her people and restore
            freedom to the galaxy, Princess Leia Organa, who is in custody of
            the stolen plans attempts to race home aboard the Tantive IV.
            However, her ship is intercepted by the Imperial I-class Star
            Destroyer Devastator over the desert planet of Tatooine.

            Imperial stormtroopers manage to board the ship, and after defeating
            the small number of guards defending the ship, the Sith Lord Darth
            Vader arrives to assess the damage. Vader is outraged and questions
            Captain Antilles, whom he eventually strangles and kills. Hiding on
            the ship, Princess Leia is spotted by stormtroopers. They shoot her
            with a stun blast and bring her before Vader. However, before being
            detained, Leia was able to record a holographic message with the
            help of R2-D2, and assigned the droid the responsibility of taking
            the message to a Jedi-in-hiding on Tatooine. Vader orders a message
            be sent to the Imperial Senate, informing them that the ship was
            destroyed, with everyone on board killed. R2-D2 and C-3PO use an
            escape pod in order to escape the ship and reach the planet of
            Tatooine below.

          <h4>Luke's destiny</h4>
          <blockquote>
            There's nothing for me here now. I want to learn the ways of the
            Force and become a Jedi like my father. <cite>Luke Skywalker</cite>

          <p>
            The droids are bought by moisture farmer Owen Lars and his nephew,
            Luke Skywalker. R2-D2 escapes from the Lars' homestead in search of
            an Obi-Wan Kenobi, whom the droid claims to be the property of. Luke
            and C-3PO find R2 the next day just before they are attacked by Sand
            people. Luke and his droids are rescued by Obi-Wan Kenobi or, as
            Luke knows him, Ben Kenobi. Obi-Wan takes Luke to his home.
          </p>
          <p>
            Luke receives his father's lightsaber, as Obi-Wan recalls his own
            friendship with Luke's father. Luke is told that a Jedi named Darth
            Vader betrayed and murdered his father. After discovering Princess
            Leia's message carried by R2-D2, Obi-Wan attempts to persuade Luke
            to accompany him to Alderaan. Luke refuses to go until he discovers
            that his aunt and uncle were brutally murdered by stormtroopers
            searching for the droids. Luke, Obi-Wan, and the two droids travel
            to Mos Eisley to find passage to Alderaan, Princess Leia's home
            planet.

            For 17,000 credits, 2,000 in advance and 15,000 upon arrival,
            smuggler Han Solo and his First Mate, a Wookiee named Chewbacca,
            agree to take the four of them to Alderaan aboard their ship, the
            Millennium Falcon. After brief scuffles with the Empire and henchmen
            sent by Jabba the Hutt, the Falcon escapes the Imperial Blockade at
            Mos Eisley and Han sets a course for Alderaan, unaware that the
            planet was about to be mercilessly destroyed by the Empire.

          <p>
            In Alderaan's place, they find what seems to be an asteroid field.
            The planet was destroyed by the dreaded Death Star, on the orders of
            Grand Moff Tarkin, to set an example of the power of the Empire. The
            Millennium Falcon is pulled aboard the Death Star by its powerful
            tractor beam.
          </p>
          <p>
            From hidden smuggling compartments, Solo ambushes two stormtroopers
            of the Imperial scanning crew. With Han and Luke now disguised as
            the two stormtroopers, the group begins to figure out how to escape.
            Obi-Wan separates from the group to disable the tractor beam,
            leaving the others alone. While connected to the Imperial Network,
            R2-D2 discovers Princess Leia is aboard the station. Luke convinces
            Han and Chewbacca to rescue her with the vague promise of a grand
            reward. Han and Chewbacca reluctantly agree. Luke plans to march
            into Detention Block AA-23, claiming that Chewbacca is part of a
            prisoner transfer. C-3PO and R2-D2 are instructed to remain behind,
            and the trio sets off on their rescue attempt. Luke's plan works
            flawlessly in that they are quick to subdue the officers and guards
            in the princess's cell block. Unfortunately, no one thought to plan
            for their escape, and Leia takes charge, blasting a hole in a nearby
            grate and jumping through while Han and Luke hold off a squad of
            stormtroopers. Chewbacca, Luke and Han all dive after the princess
            into the unknown.
          </p>
          <p>
            Unfortunately, the grate covers a chute that leads to a garbage
            compactor that is also home to a resident dianoga. Soon after
            landing, the creature pulls Luke under the surface, but releases him
            and is scared away when the Imperials realize where the heroes
            escaped to and activate the compactor. As the walls close in on the
            foursome, Luke desperately calls to C-3PO over his comlink asking
            for the compactor to be shut down. R2-D2 manages to shut down the
            compactor just in time, although, amidst the muffled cries of joy
            over the comlink, C-3PO is briefly convinced that his master and
            friends have been crushed.
          </p>
          <p>
            After escaping from the trash compactor, the group hurries back to
            the Millennium Falcon, hoping that Obi-Wan has successfully shut
            down the tractor beam. They encounter stormtroopers on their way to
            the ship, evading and blasting their way past them.

          <h4>Sacrifice and victory</h4>
          <blockquote>
            "This will be a day long remembered. It has seen the end of Kenobi.
            It will soon see the end of the Rebellion." <cite>Darth Vader</cite>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            Obi-Wan, on the other hand, was destined to meet with Darth Vader.
            After a short duel with his former Padawan, Obi-Wan sacrifices
            himself, thus becoming one with the Force and allowing Luke and the
            others to escape. Horrified and angered having witnessed Obi-Wan's
            demise at the hands of Vader, Luke takes his final blasts at the
            stormtroopers and dashes onto the Millennium Falcon.
          </p>
          <p>
            After fighting a squadron of TIE fighters, the Millennium Falcon
            meets the Rebel Alliance on Yavin 4, and the information in R2-D2 is
            turned over. General Dodonna plans the attack on the Death Star, an
            attack so audacious as to receive an unenthusiastic reaction from
            the pilots. To add to Luke's dismay, Han leaves after receiving his
            reward.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Rebel strike force begins its attack on the Death Star, as the
            space station approaches the Rebel base on Yavin 4. A group of
            starfighters assaults a trench on the Death Star's surface to hit
            the station's vulnerable spot before it can destroy the Alliance's
            base. During this, most of the Rebel craft, including Luke's friend
            Biggs Darklighter, are picked off by Imperial fighters led by Darth
            Vader. Just as Vader opens fire on Luke from his personal TIE
            Advanced fighter, Han returns in the Millennium Falcon and attacks
            the Imperials, resulting in Vader's ship getting knocked out of the
            trench. Luke, aided by the voice of Kenobi and guided by the Force,
            accurately fires two proton torpedoes into a small exhaust port
            leading to the Death Star's reactor, and the battle station
            explodes.
          </p>
          <p>
            The few remaining ships (those of Wedge Antilles, Luke, Han, and a
            Y-wing Pilot) return to Yavin 4 and a victory celebration commences,
            complete with medals for the heroes, Han Solo and Luke Skywalker,
            presented by Princess Leia.
