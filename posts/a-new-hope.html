          Have you been in many battles? Several, I think. Actually, there's not
          much to tell. I'm not much more than an interpreter, and not very good
          at telling stories. Well, not at making them interesting, anyways.
          Well, my little friend, you've got something jammed in here real good.
          Were you on a cruiser or... He says he's the property of Obi-Wan
          Kenobi, a resident of these parts. And it's a private message for him.
          Quite frankly, sir I don't know what he's talking about. Our last
          master was Captain Antilles, but with what we've been through, this
          little R2 unit has become a bit eccentric. Obi-Wan Kenobi? I wonder if
          he means old Ben Kenobi? I beg your pardon, sir, but do you know what
          he's talking about? Well, I don't know anyone named Obi-Wan, but old
          Ben lives out beyond the dune sea. He's kind of a strange old hermit.
          I wonder who she is. It sounds like she's in trouble. I'd better play
          back the whole thing. How did I get into this mess? I really don't
          know how. We seem to be made to suffer. It's our lot in life. I've got
          to rest before I fall apart. My joints are almost frozen. What a
          desolate place this is. Where are you going? Well, I'm not going that
          way. It's much too rocky. This way is much easier. What makes you
          think there are settlements over there? Don't get technical with me.
          What mission? What are you talking about? I've had just about enough
          of you! Go that way! You'll be malfunctioning within a day, you
          nearsighted scrap pile! And don't let me catch you following me
          begging for help, because you won't get it. No more adventures. I'm
          not going that way. Don't be too proud of this technological terror
          you've constructed. The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant
          next to the power of the Force. Don't try to frighten us with your
          sorcerer's ways, Lord Vader. Your sad devotion to that ancient
          religion has not helped you conjure up the stolen data tapes, or given
          you clairvoyance enough to find the Rebel's hidden fort... I find your
          lack of faith disturbing. Enough of this! Vader, release him! As you
          wish. This bickering is pointless. Lord Vader will provide us with the
          location of the Rebel fortress by the time this station is
          operational. We will then crush the Rebellion with one swift stroke.
          He says it's the best he can do. Since the XP-38 came out, they're
          just not in demand. It will be enough. If the ship's as fast as he's
          boasting, we ought to do well. Her resistance to the mind probe is
          considerable. It will be some time before we can extract any
          information from her. The final check-out is complete. All systems are
          operational. What course shall we set? Perhaps she would respond to an
          alternative form of persuasion. What do you mean? I think it is time
          we demonstrate the full power of this station. Set your course for
          Princess Leia's home planet of Alderaan. With pleasure. Holding her is
          dangerous. If word of this gets out, it could generate sympathy for
          the Rebellion in the senate. I have traced the Rebel spies to her. Now
          she is my only link to find their secret base! She'll die before she
          tells you anything. Leave that to me. Send a distress signal and then
          inform the senate that all aboard were killed! Lord Vader, the battle
          station plans are not aboard this ship! And no transmissions were
          made. An escape pod was jettisoned during the fighting, but no life
          forms were aboard. She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod.
          Send a detachment down to retrieve them. See to it personally,
          Commander. There'll be no one to stop us this time. Yes, sir. Owen, he
          can't stay here forever. Most of his friends have gone. It means so
          much to him. I'll make it up to him next year. I promise. Luke's just
          not a farmer, Owen. He has too much of his father in him. That's what
          I'm afraid of.
