      Alert all commands. Ready for the tractor beam. Artoo, come back at once!
      You haven't finished with me yet! You don't know how to fix the
      hyperdrive. Chewbacca can do it. I'm standing here in pieces, and you're
      having delusions of grandeur! Oh, you did it! Oh, thank goodness we're
      coming out of the asteroid field. Let's get out of here. Ready for
      light-speed? One...two...three! It's not fair! The transfer circuits are
      working. It's not my fault! No light-speed? It's not my fault. Sir, we
      just lost the main rear deflector shield. One more direct hit on the back
      quarter and we're done for. Turn her around. I said turn her around! I'm
      going to put all power in the front shield. You're going to attack them?!
      Sir, the odds of surviving a direct assault on an Imperial Star
      Destroyer... Shut up! This ground sure feels strange. It doesn't feel like
      rock at all. There's an awful lot of moisture in here. I don't know. I
      have a bad feeling about this. Yeah. Watch out! Yeah, that's what I
      thought. Mynock. Chewie, check the rest of the ship, make sure there
      aren't any more attached. They're chewing on the power cables. Mynocks? Go
      on inside. We'll clean them off if there are any more. Ohhh! Go away! Go
      away! Beastly thing. Shoo! Shoo! Wait a minute... All right, Chewie, let's
      get out of here! If only you had attached my legs, I wouldn't be in this
      ridiculous position. Now, remember, Chewbacca, you have a responsibility
      to me, so don't do anything foolish. What's going on...buddy? You're being
      put into carbon freeze. What if he doesn't survive? He's worth a lot to
      me. The Empire will compensate you if he dies. Put him in! Oh, no! No, no,
      no! Stop, Chewbacca, stop...! Stop, Chewie, stop! Do you hear me? Stop!
      Yes, stop, please! I'm not ready to die. Chewie! Chewie, this won't help
      me. Hey! Save your strength. There'll be another time. The princess - you
      have to take care of her. You hear me? I love you! I know. What...what's
      going on? Turn around, Chewbacca, I can't see. Oh...they've encased him in
      carbonite. He should be quite well-protected - if he survives the freezing
      process, that is. Well, Calrissian, did he survive? Yes, he's alive. And
      in perfect hibernation. He's all yours bounty hunter. Reset the chamber
      for Skywalker. Skywalker has just landed, my lord. Good. See to it that he
      finds his way here. Calrissian, take the princess and the Wookiee to my
      ship. You said they'd be left in the city under my supervision. I am
      altering the deal. Pray I don't alter it any further. The ship is almost
      finished. Two or Three more things and we're in great shape. The sooner
      the better. Something's wrong here. No one has seen or knows anything
      about Threepio. He's been gone too long to have gotten lost. Relax. I'll
      talk to Lando and see what I can find out. I don't trust Lando. Well, I
      don't trust him, either. But he is my friend. Besides, we'll soon be gone.
      And then you're as good as gone, aren't you? Luke! You must complete the
      training. I can't keep the vision out of my head. They're my friends. I've
      got to help them. You must not go! But Han and Leia will die if I don't.
      You don't know that. Even Yoda cannot see their fate. But I can help them!
      I feel the Force! But you cannot control it. This is a dangerous time for
      you, when you will be tempted by the dark side of the Force. Yes, yes. To
      Obi-Wan you listen. The cave. Remember your failure at the cave! But I've
      learned so much since then. Master Yoda, I promise to return and finish
      what I've begun. You have my word. It is you and your abilities the
      Emperor wants. that is why your friends are made to suffer. And that is
      why I have to go. Luke, I don't want to lose you to the Emperor the way I
      lost Vader. You won't. Stopped they must be. On this depends. Bounty
      hunters. We don't need that scum. Those Rebels won't escape us. Sir, we
      have a priority signal from the Star Destroyer Avenger. Right. ...there
      will be a substantial reward for the one who finds the Millennium Falcon.
      You are free to use any methods necessary, but I want them alive. No
      disintegrations. As you wish. Lord Vader! My lord, we have them.
