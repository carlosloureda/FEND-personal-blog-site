      The Emperor knew, as I did, if Anakin were to have any offspring, they
      would be a threat to him. That is the reason why your sister remains
      safely anonymous. Leia! Leia's my sister. Your insight serves you well.
      Bury your feelings deep down, Luke. They do you credit. But they could be
      made to serve the Emperor. We're coming! Come on! Come on! Oh, Artoo,
      hurry! My goodness! Artoo, why did you have to be so brave? Well, I
      suppose I could hotwire this thing. I'll cover you. Yes! I said closer!
      Move as close as you can and engage those Star Destroyers at point-blank
      range. At that close range, we won't last long against those Star
      Destroyers. We'll last longer then we will against that Death Star...and
      we might just take a few of them with us. She's gonna blow! I'm hit! The
      main entrance to the control bunker's on the far side of that landing
      platform. This isn't gonna be easy. Hey, don't worry. Chewie and me got
      into a lot of places more heavily guarded than this. What's he saying? He
      says there's a secret entrance on the other side of the ridge. Perhaps you
      refer to the imminent attack of your Rebel fleet. Yes...I assure you we
      are quite safe from your friends here. Your overconfidence is your
      weakness. Your faith in your friends is yours. It is pointless to resist,
      my son. Everything that has transpired has done so according to my design.
      Your friends up there on the Sanctuary Moon are walking into a trap. As is
      your Rebel fleet! It was I who allowed the Alliance to know the location
      of the shield generator. It is quite safe from your pitiful little band.
      An entire legion of my best troops awaits them. Oh...I'm afraid the
      deflector shield will be quite operational when your friends arrive. Luke,
      what's wrong? Leia... do you remember your mother? Your real mother? Just
      a little bit. She died when I was very young. What do you remember?
      Just...images, really. Feelings. Tell me. She was very beautiful. Kind,
      but...sad. Why are you asking me all this? I have no memory of my mother.
      I never knew her. Luke, tell me. What's troubling you? Vader is
      here...now, on this moon. How do you know? I felt his presence. He's come
      for me. He can feel when I'm near. That's why I have to go. As long as I
      stay, I'm endangering the group and our mission here. I have to face him.
      Why? He's my father. Your father? There's more. It won't be easy for you
      to hear it, but you must. Yes, Artoo. I was just coming to that. What's
      going on? I don't know. Wonderful! We are now a part of the tribe. Just
      what I always wanted. Well, short help is better than no help at all,
      Chewie. Thank you. Okay. He says the scouts are going to show us the
      quickest way to the shield generator. Good. How far is it? Ask him. We
      need some fresh supplies, too. And try and get our weapons back. And hurry
      up, will ya? I haven't got all day. I have a really bad feeling about
      this. What did he say? I'm rather embarrassed, General Solo, but it
      appears you are to be the main course at a banquet in my honor. Leia! Oh!
      Your Royal Highness. But these are my friends. Threepio, tell them they
      must be set free. Somehow, I got the feeling that didn't help us very
      much. Threepio, tell them if they don't do as you wish, you'll become
      angry and use your magic. But Master Luke, what magic? I couldn't possibly
      -- Just tell them. You see, Master Luke they didn't believe me. Just as I
      said they wouldn't. Wha-wha-what's happening! Oh! Oh, dear! Oh! Put me
      down! He-e-elp! Master Luke! Artoo! Somebody, somebody, help! Master Luke,
      Artoo! Artoo, quickly! Do something, somebody! Oh! Ohhh! Oh, oh, oh, oh!
      Thank goodness. Thanks, Threepio. I...I never knew I had it in me.
